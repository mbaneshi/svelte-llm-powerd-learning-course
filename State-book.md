**let focus for now on Part 3: State Management and Advanced Techniques**
Stores:
svelte/store: writable, readable, derived, readonly, get.
The store contract.
When to use stores.
Context: getContext, setContext, hasContext, getAllContexts.
Component Lifecycle: onMount, onDestroy, tick. Deprecated: beforeUpdate, afterUpdate
Imperative Component API: mount, unmount, render, hydrate. , if you want to write book for this part , how you crrate table of content for it ?

Okay, let's dive into **Part 3: State Management and Advanced Techniques** and create a table of contents for a book-style presentation of this section.

**Book Title:** Mastering State and Advanced Techniques in SvelteKit

**Part 3: Table of Contents: State Management and Advanced Techniques**

**Introduction to Part 3**
*   Why State Management is Crucial
*   Beyond Component State: Advanced Concepts
*   Navigating SvelteKit's Advanced API
*   Overview of topics covered in this Part

**Chapter 1: Svelte Stores: Advanced Reactive Data**
*   **Understanding Svelte Stores**
    *   What are Stores?
    *   The Store Contract: A Shared Interface for Reactivity
        *  The `subscribe` Method: Listening for Changes
        * The `set` method: Updating a `writable` store
        *  The `update` Method: Calculating New Values

*   **Built-in Stores in `svelte/store`**
    *   `writable` Stores: Mutable Data
         * The `set` Method: Updating a writable store
         *  The `update` Method: Calculating New Values
         *  The Optional `start` Function
          * When to use writable stores
    *  `readable` Stores: Immutable Data Streams
          * The `start` Function
          * When to use readable stores
    *   `derived` Stores: Computed Values
         * Deriving Values from a Single Store
         * Deriving Values from Multiple Stores
         *  Asynchronous Derivations: The set callback

    *   `readonly` Stores: Immutable views over other stores
    *   `get`: Accessing Store Values Synchronously
*   **When to Use Stores**
    *   Avoiding Prop Drilling
    *   Managing Shared Application State
        * Why not using global vars?
    *   Synchronizing with External Systems
*   **Advanced Store Usage**
    *   Alternatives to Stores
         * Using `$state` objects with properties.
         * `.svelte.js` files

    *   Creating Custom Stores

**Chapter 2: Context API: Scoped State Sharing**

*   **Introduction to Context**
    *   What is Context and When to Use It?
    *   Limitations of component properties for shared state
    *   A better way using `setContext` and `getContext`
*   **Using `setContext`**
    *   Associating Data with a Component
    *   Accessing Context Values via `getContext`
    *   How context is scoped
*   **Practical Examples**
    *   Creating a Theme Provider
    *   Passing down form data
*   **Additional API**
     *   `hasContext`: Checking for Context Existence
     *   `getAllContexts`: Accessing all Parent Contexts
* **Encapsulating context interactions**
    *   Type-safe functions to interact with context

**Chapter 3: Component Lifecycle: Connecting to the Outside World**
*   **Understanding Component Lifecycle**
    *   Creation & Destruction
    *   The Absence of Updates: Thinking in Terms of Effects
*   **`onMount`**
    *   Running Code After the Component is Attached to the DOM
    *   Returning a Teardown Function
     *   Usage with a `canvas` example
*   **`onDestroy`**
    *   Executing Code Before Component Unmounts
    *   Clean Up Resources like timers, subscriptions etc
*   **`tick`**
    *   Guaranteeing DOM Updates: When to Use `tick`

*   **Deprecated Lifecycle Hooks**
    *    Understanding the limitations of `beforeUpdate` and `afterUpdate`
    * Why `beforeUpdate` and `afterUpdate` were replaced
         * Using `$effect.pre` instead of `beforeUpdate`
         * Using `$effect` instead of `afterUpdate`
    *  Chat window example

**Chapter 4: Imperative Component API: Taking Control**
*   **When to Use the Imperative API**
    *   Programmatic Creation of Components
    *   Interacting with Component Instances
    *   Testing
*   **Mounting and Unmounting Components**
    *   `mount()`: Instantiating and Attaching Components to the DOM
    *   `unmount()`: Removing Components and Cleaning Up
*   **Programmatic Rendering**
    * `render()`: Server-Side Rendering of Components
    * `hydrate()`: Making Pre-rendered Components Interactive

**Conclusion to Part 3**
*   Key Takeaways and When to Use Which State Management Technique
*   Future Trends in SvelteKit and State Management
*   Next Steps: Moving to More Complex Features

**Appendix**

*   API Reference for:
    *   `svelte/store`
    *   `svelte`
       *  `onMount`, `onDestroy`, `tick`
       *  `getContext`, `setContext`, `hasContext`, `getAllContexts`
        *  `mount`, `unmount`, `render`, `hydrate`

This structure is designed to:

*   **Guide Learning:** Present topics in a logical order, building from core principles to advanced techniques.
*   **Provide Clarity:** Clearly define and explain each concept.
*   **Offer Practicality:**  Focus on _when_ and _why_ to use certain features.
*   **Encourage Reference:** Include the API reference for easy lookup.
